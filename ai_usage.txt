## ðŸ¤– AI Tools Usage & Documentation

This project was built using knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Node.js.

During the development process, ChatGPT (by OpenAI) was used as a learning and support tool for the following:

- Understanding how to securely compare passwords and hash them using `bcryptjs`
- Figuring out how to structure login/logout flows using session-like behavior
- Solving Git errors( remote origin issues, push problems)
- Helping create clear documentation such as README and final documentation for project

The actual code â€” including HTML structure, CSS styling, and Node.js logic.  
AI support was used **only to understand certain functions, improve flow, and polish the final product**.

This statement is made to clear project rules on AI tool usage.
